                    The depariment of Chancelor college is looking for people to participate in some rasearch programes. Biology
                    covers a lot of fields like microbiology, botany, human biology etc, chancellor college is looking for people that would like to take part in these reseach programs. Participants will be offered a certificate of the field they participated in, at the end of their 2 weeks program for a successful research. The deprtment will also hire some participant for a major research program.

                    Polytechnic is recruiting people of interest to take part in some physics programs.
                    The programs are to extend some basic knowledge of people in some fields like electronic appliance repairing, simple applince creation etc. As one of the major divisions of science, the physics department is conducting this 2 weeks exercise for people to extend there knowledge to par with new technology developments. The recruits will be awarded a certificate at the end of the program.

                <P>
                    Computers are becoming widely used world wide, as the number of computers increases so does their functional complexity. The complexity of some recent machines has encouraged the departiment of Computer Science to conduct a quick education introducing people to common operating systems. The classes will take a duration of 2-4 weeks atmost, and at the end of these weeks the participants will have earned themselves a certificate or admitted to study further for a diplomer according to how they perform.
